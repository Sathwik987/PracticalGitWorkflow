usp_UpdateLoanMajorMilestoneFact_SourceDeletes

If it is deleted in loanidentifierdim and update the majormilestone fact and set it to deleted in the majormilestone fact

later day - uncommented the sourcerecorddeleted 

Their is different store proc which also deletes the records - usp_UpsertClosingMilestone_RescindedClosings

When people change their closing date so we get a record that they close basically they take that away and change the closing date...

What this proc does is when closing date is moved..they set it to 1 (update statement) which means deleted. What happening was we are seeing the loans the closings were rescinded that equals to source record deleted = 1 but when we get new closing we need to insert the new record. Y was thinking this was only changing because he was thinking of the loanidentifierdimn. 

Rescinded closings where we do want to keep multiple records per closings per loan and we wanted to keep it rescinded closing where we need to store history.
